# üìò Section 1: Nginx Overview 
## What is Nginx?
Nginx is a web server that serves static content (HTML, images, etc.) to web browsers. It also provides additional features like reverse proxy, load balancing, and HTTP caching.

### üí° Features of Nginx:
- A reverse proxy
- Load balancer
- HTTP cache
- Mail proxy

## üìä Why use Nginx over HTTPd (Apache)?
- Nginx handles many users at once more efficiently than Apache.
- Nginx uses an event-driven model, which is faster and uses less memory.
- Apache (httpd) uses a process/thread-based model, which can be heavier under load.
- Nginx uses less CPU and RAM, making it ideal for high-performance setups.
- Nginx is optimized for serving static files like images, CSS, and HTML quickly.

**Event-Driven Model(Nginx):**
when a worker process initiates an I/O operation (like reading from a disk or network socket), it does not wait for the operation to complete. Instead, it registers a callback and continues to process other tasks. When the I/O operation finishes, the callback is triggered, and the worker process handles the result. This prevents blocking and allows a single worker to manage many connections simultaneously.

### The Core Problem Nginx Solve: The C10K Problem

**The C10K Problem**, This was the challenge of handling ten thousand concurrent connections on a single server. Traditional web servers (like Apache in its initial prefork mode) used a "one process per connection" or "one thread per connection" model. Creating a process/thread for each connection is expensive in terms of memory and CPU context-switching. At ten thousand connections, the server would grind to a halt.

Nginx's Answer: The Event-Driven, Asynchronous, Non-Blocking Architecture
Nginx elegantly solves the C10K problem by using a event-driven architecture. Instead of a process per connection, it uses a small number of highly efficient worker processes that handle thousands of connections simultaneously.
